## Components

### Desktop Application

The desktop application is an Electron-based collaborative code editor. For detailed information about the desktop app, including build and installation instructions, see the [desktop-app README](desktop-app/README.md).

**Current Build Status:** Development build available for macOS. Please note that this is currently an unsigned development build and will trigger security warnings on macOS. See the desktop-app README for detailed instructions on handling security warnings.

## Development Status

- âœ… Basic real-time collaboration
- âœ… Desktop application (macOS development build)
- âœ… Web client interface
- ðŸš§ Code signing and notarization (in progress)
- ðŸš§ Windows and Linux support (planned)

## Known Issues

### macOS Security Warnings

The current development build will trigger security warnings on macOS due to being unsigned. This is a known issue that we're actively working on. For now, users can:

1. Right-click the app and select "Open" to bypass the warning
2. Go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy to allow the app to run

We're working on implementing proper code signing and notarization for future releases.
