# Collaborative Code Editor

A real-time collaborative code editor desktop application built with Electron, Socket.IO, and Monaco Editor. This application allows multiple users to collaborate on code in real-time, making it perfect for pair programming, teaching, or remote collaboration.

## Features

- üöÄ Real-time code synchronization across multiple users
- üíª Desktop application for macOS (Windows & Linux support coming soon)
- üé® Beautiful, modern interface with dark theme
- üìù Monaco Editor (same as VS Code) with syntax highlighting
- üîå Easy session sharing with automatic port management
- üîÑ Instant connection status feedback
- üéØ Simple and intuitive user interface

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14.0.0 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (v6.0.0 or higher)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (for development)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/collaborative-code-editor.git
cd collaborative-code-editor/desktop-app
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

## Building the Application

### Development Build (macOS)

Currently, we provide an unsigned development build for macOS. To build the application:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create development build
npm run dist
```

The build will be available in the `dist/mac-arm64` directory.

### Installing the Development Build

Since this is an unsigned development build, you'll encounter security warnings when trying to run the application. Here's how to handle them:

1. **First Launch:**
   - Locate the app in Finder
   - Right-click (or Control-click) the app
   - Select "Open" from the context menu
   - Click "Open" in the security dialog

2. **Alternative Method:**
   - Try to open the app normally (it will be blocked)
   - Go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General
   - Look for a message about the blocked app
   - Click "Open Anyway"

### Distribution Notes

For distributing the development build within a local network:

1. **Sharing the Build:**
   - Zip the `.app` directory from `dist/mac-arm64`
   - Share the zip file with other users
   - Recipients should follow the installation steps above

2. **Network Usage:**
   - Ensure all users are on the same local network
   - The app will automatically handle port management
   - Share the session URL displayed in the app

### Future Updates

We are actively working on:
- Implementing proper code signing and notarization
- Creating signed builds for distribution
- Adding Windows and Linux support

### Windows (Coming Soon)
```bash
npm run dist:win
```

### Linux (Coming Soon)
```bash
npm run dist:linux
```

## Development

### Architecture

The application consists of three main components:

1. **Electron Main Process** (`main.js`)
   - Handles window management
   - Manages port allocation
   - Controls application lifecycle

2. **Frontend** (`index.html`)
   - User interface
   - Monaco Editor integration
   - Socket.IO client connection

3. **Socket.IO Server**
   - Real-time communication
   - Code synchronization
   - Session management

### Key Dependencies

- `electron`: Desktop application framework
- `socket.io`: Real-time communication
- `monaco-editor`: Code editor
- `express`: Web server for Socket.IO

### Development Workflow

1. Make changes to the source code
2. Test using `npm start`
3. Build using `npm run dist`
4. Test the built application

### Adding New Features

When adding new features:

1. Update the main process (`main.js`) if needed
2. Modify the frontend (`index.html`)
3. Test real-time functionality
4. Update documentation
5. Build and test the distribution

## Usage

### Starting a New Session

1. Launch the application
2. Click "Start New Session"
3. Share the displayed URL with collaborators

### Joining a Session

1. Launch the application
2. Paste the session URL
3. Click "Connect"

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Commit your changes
4. Push to the branch
5. Create a Pull Request

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port Already in Use**
   - The application will automatically try alternative ports
   - Check if another instance is running

2. **Connection Issues**
   - Verify the URL is correct
   - Check your network connection
   - Ensure the host application is running

3. **Editor Not Loading**
   - Clear the application cache
   - Reinstall dependencies
   - Check console for errors

4. **Security Warnings**
   - Follow the installation steps above for handling security warnings
   - Each user will need to approve the app on their system
   - Security warnings are expected behavior for development builds

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Windows and Linux support
- [ ] Multiple editor themes
- [ ] File system integration
- [ ] User cursors and selections
- [ ] Chat functionality
- [ ] Session persistence
- [ ] Custom language support
- [ ] Collaborative debugging
